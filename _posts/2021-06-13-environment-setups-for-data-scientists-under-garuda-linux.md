I came across Garuda Linux and was fascinated by the its beauty. Even though I have used MacOS for two years in work and entertainment, I don't mind trying such fancy Linux. One can check the post in [Environment Setups for Data Scientists under Garuda Linux](https://medium.com/geekculture/environment-setups-for-data-scientists-under-garuda-linux-ed6492a2a1ab) and the corresponding codes in [my Github](https://github.com/AlfredSAM/medium_blogs/tree/main/Environment_Setups_Data_Science_Garuda_Linux).
