After several trials to directly write posts in [my medium](https://alfredfaisam.medium.com/), I just made up my mind to build the blog home here. Well, actually I enjoy the well-built society in [medium](https://medium.com/) and actually I follow several decent channels there, e.g. [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). However, I get used to markdown and latex (for math) especially for scientific posts, but I cannot use them for the posts in [medium](https://medium.com/) and I always get stuck for the formula editing. For the older posts in [my medium](https://alfredfaisam.medium.com/) I just put the corresponding links in my blog home here, but for the new posts I will write them here and probably export them to [my medium](https://alfredfaisam.medium.com/) or [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfred-fai-sam/).


This is my first post published in [Neovim Setups for Data Science
](https://medium.com/geekculture/neovim-setups-for-data-science-5ea251e3735f). In recent years I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for coding works. They are both well-known editors more efficient than current electron-based editors, such as [atom](https://atom.io/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and etc, always suffering latency and overhead problems. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is primitive and easily set up in unix-like systems. Generally speaking, Linux system (NO GUI) is usually preferred in the cloud or server. If one can be familiar with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) or [vim](https://www.vim.org/), then the remote working mode is so convenient: one can just use the lightweight notebook to ssh connect to the cloud and server from anywhere Internet can cover. Within this post I just introduce the latest version Neovim 0.5 much approaching to [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and most importantly several typical plugins for data science are shared. Just for fun!
