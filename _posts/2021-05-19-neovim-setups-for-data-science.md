This is my first post published in [Medium](https://medium.com/geekculture/neovim-setups-for-data-science-5ea251e3735f) and please check. I just determine to construct my blog home page here for sharing, just because I get used to markdown and latex especially for scientific posts. For the older posts in Medium I just put the corresponding links in my blog home, but for the new posts I will write them here and probably export them to Medium or LinkedIn.
