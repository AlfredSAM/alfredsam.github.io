My name is Alfred F. SAM. 

- I work as a data scientist. 
- My daily works involve applications of machine learning and statistics techniques to solve for various data challenges, e.g. predictive models for health risks and interpretability.
- Deeply impressed by Paul Anthony Samuelson's great textbook _Economics_, I am always interested in Econometrics modeling, applied Microeconomics, and game theory.
- I am fond of sharing, with the belief of my university motto: _Education for service_. In recent years I enjoy giving lectures in university if time allows.


### My story

"Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get."

Exactly it describes my past experience. I was fascinated by Economics and game theory when I was an undergraduate, but I determined to pursue the PhD degree in Marketing in business school. When I tried preparing the career in academics, I fell in love with Micro-econometrics and machine learning and made up my mind to explore the interaction between business strategies and consumers’ behaviors in industry instead of university. I also like sharing, so in recent years I discuss my experience and findings with the youngsters (I am too!) in the university. I should have begun writing earlier, and now I have a chance.
